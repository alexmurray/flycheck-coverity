;;;; Setup

;; (eval-after-load 'flycheck
;;   '(progn
;;      (require 'flycheck-coverity)
;;      (flycheck-coverity-setup)
;;      ;; chain after cppcheck since this is the last checker in the upstream
;;      ;; configuration
;;      (flycheck-add-next-checker 'c/c++-cppcheck '(warning . coverity))))

;; If you do not use cppcheck then chain after clang / gcc / other C checker
;; that you use
